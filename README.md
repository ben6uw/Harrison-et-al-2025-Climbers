**Abstract**
Studies in laboratory organisms typically minimize all environmental and genetic variation other than the intervention of interest. In aging studies, these highly controlled conditions have yielded profound insights into aging. But even within isogenic cohorts of lab animals in controlled environments, we observe substantial variation in lifespan. Here we exploit the climbing behavior of Drosophila to study variation in mortality among isogenic populations in a controlled environment. We show that fractionating large cohorts of relatively young isogenic flies by climbing behavior predicts future mortality risk and stress sensitivity. Using metabolomics to dissect this variation, we find metabolites whose abundances differ among the fractions. We also take advantage of the large number of individuals in each fraction, and the ease with which they can be collected, to examine the covariance structure of metabolites in flies that are genetically identical, but divisible into short-lived and long-lived fractions. In doing so, we identify the taurine pathway as a potential nexus among biomarkers of intrinsic mortality risk.
